 The Codable protocol was introduced with in Swift 4
 
 This struct is Codable without having to explicitly conform to the Encodable and Decodable
 protocols because it uses standard library types like String, Int and Double. You can also
 use Foundation types like Date, Data, and URL. So, any type whose properties are codable
 automatically conforms to Codable.
 
 Adopting Codable on your own types enables you to serialize them to and from any of the
 built-in data formats, and any formats provided by custom encoders and decoders. For example,
 the PixabayImage structure can be encoded using both the PropertyListEncoder and JSONEncoder
 classes, even though PixabayImage itself contains no code to specifically handle property lists
 or JSON.
 
 Built-in collections such as Array and Dictionary also conform to Codable whenever they
 contain codable types.
